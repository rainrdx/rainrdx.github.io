    <div class="article-style"><p>Functional neuroimaging is not a theory-driven research program, in the sense that a systematic theory of cognition served as the basis for neuroimaging.
In fact, forty years after the invention of functional neuroimaging, scientists are not much closer to a systematic theory of cognition.
And after forty years of using functional neuroimaging, scientists only start to understand, preliminarily, the kind of neural activity that functional neuroimaging is actually measuring.</p>

<p>Instead, functional neuroimaging is a technique-driven research program, in the sense that existing techniques served as the basis for functional neuroimaging.
But how did scientists use existing techniques to create functional neuroimaging?
What does a technique-driven research program look like?
In this chapter, I argue that scientists invented neuroimaging out of exploratory invention, thanks to the modularity of existing techniques.</p>

<p>The invention of neuroimaging was the result of exploratory invention.
After World War II, institutions as the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and scientists worked in nuclear research faced the challenge to justify the continued existence of large scale nuclear research.
They wanted to find exciting, valuable civilian uses of nuclear power.
One potential direction for valuable, civilian uses of nuclear power was to use radioactive isotopes to treat or diagnose tumors.
With the vague goal in mind, and armed with cyclotrons onsite to produce radioactive isotopes on demand, medical scientists, especially teams at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), started to play with existing techniques.
In other words, they started exploratory invention.
Teams at MGH and WUSTL would literally form a vague idea, put the components together, and test the new machine to see if the machine performed close to the vague idea.</p>

<p>From the exploratory invention, the first prototype of neuroimaging machine was born.
The MGH team cobbled together some commercial components, scanned the brain of a patient suffering from brain cancer, and saw nothing.
Not giving up, the team moved the patient off-center, made another scan, and all of a sudden they saw a shadowy region in the image &ndash; exactly where the tumors were.
The MGH team had no idea why the machine worked in unintended ways.
But it worked.</p>

<p>The announcement of the first prototype and procedure to use it was very curious, although by no means rare in announcement of new techniques.
The MGH team published a paper which starts by saying: &ldquo;POSITRON-EMITTING ISOTOPES offer possibilities of better resolution for tumor localization&rdquo;.
In other words, they cautiously suggested that the new technique might work.
They went on to describe the basic physics and the design of their imaging device.
Then, after the description of their device, they had a section called &ldquo;Results,&rdquo; using multiple detection instruments to figure out the parameters of the device they just designed, very much like a study of an unknown phenomenon.
In this five-page long paper, they only dedicated two paragraphs to the actual application of the machine on a real patient.
They used Figure 7 and Figure 8 in this paper and demonstrated that the device worked, although they did not explain why or how the device worked.</p>

<p>The exploratory invention is essentially an evolutionary process.
In the example, on the one hand, research teams had the ultimate goal to use nuclear power in some form to treat or diagnose cancer.
In a way, the ultimate goal served as the &ldquo;selective pressure&rdquo;.
On the other hand, research teams combined existing techniques based on vague ideas, and tested them to see if the new machine could help to realize their ultimate goal.
Based on the results, scientists could improve on some of the components or swap in and out some of the components.
In other words, research teams were trying to &ldquo;mutate&rdquo; their techniques to see if their techniques could further their goal.</p>

<p>The success of the exploratory invention is enabled by the modularity of the components in neuroimaging.
Modularity is the feature of a complex, decomposable system that the system consists of components with self-contained functions\autocites{simon_architecture_1962}{wimsatt_complexity_1972}{haugeland_having_1998}.
Those components can perform their function with the right input and output.
Those functions can change in ways reasonably independent from other components.
The modularity feature enables scientists to better tweak and tinker with their techniques &ndash; improving on or changing one feature without needing to modify other well-functioning features, and ultimately reach their goal.</p>

<p>In this chapter, I use the early history of neuroimaging as a case study to offer an account of exploratory invention.
Exploratory invention is a technique-driven process to create new techniques.
Scientists bring about new techniques in exploratory invention on the basis and under the constraints not of existing theories or models, but of existing techniques and pragmatic goals.
Within the boundary of existing techniques and pragmatic goals, scientists rely on the modularity of techniques to combine them, tweak them, and swap them in and out before finally finding the satisfactory invention.</p>
