abstract = "In this paper, I examine how researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, in order to find a place for Positron Emission Tomograph in the competitive medical imaging market, designed Positron Emission Tomograph to create a new research field, now known as neuroimaging. I argue that, because the adoption of new technique into the academic and clinical routine often required the associated invention of a new field with its own research goals and norms, the philosophical attempt to search for general norms and virtues in the sciences may fail."
