      <description>Functional neuroimaging is not a theory-driven research program, in the sense that a systematic theory of cognition served as the basis for neuroimaging. In fact, forty years after the invention of functional neuroimaging, scientists are not much closer to a systematic theory of cognition. And after forty years of using functional neuroimaging, scientists only start to understand, preliminarily, the kind of neural activity that functional neuroimaging is actually measuring.
Instead, functional neuroimaging is a technique-driven research program, in the sense that existing techniques served as the basis for functional neuroimaging.</description>
