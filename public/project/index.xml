      <description>No single technological advance in the last 50 years has had a more significant and lasting influence on the structure of cognitive neuroscience than the development of functional neuroimaging. This spectacular interdisciplinary achievement, combining physics, neurology, radiology, physiology, hemodynamics, engineering, and cognitive science, allowed scientists to image the activity of the brain during the performance of cognitive tasks. This allowed scientists to draw more exacting inferences about the localization of cognitive functions in the brain, opening vast expanses of once hidden mental terra incognita to imaging technology long-valued in the medical sciences.</description>
